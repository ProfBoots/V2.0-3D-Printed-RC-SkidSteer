Hey everybody
this is V2.0 of the MiniSkidi, this is a fun introduction to robotics if you dont have much experience. 
Below is a link to the step by step guide on how to build, a youtube video talking about the changes made between 1.0 and 2.0 as well as a link to my website where you can pick up the electrical kit if you feel like supporting the channel. 

If you have any questions feel free to DM me on here and ill get back to you as soon as possible.
